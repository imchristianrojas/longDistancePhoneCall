Write a program that computes the cost of a long-distance call. The cost of the call is determined according to the following rate schedule:
Any call made between 8:00am and 6:00pm, Monday through Friday, is billed at a rate of $0.40 per minute.
Any call made before 8:00am or after 6:00pm, Monday through Friday, is charged at a rate of $0.25 per minute.
Any call made on a Saturday or Sunday is charged at a rate of $0.15 per minute.
Any call whose duration spans across multiple rate zones is charged based on the actual minutes in the corresponding rate zones.
